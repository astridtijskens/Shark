V0.3.1
Updated manual

sampling.py - main(...)
* Added functionality to continue convergence moniroting after crash

supp.py - readOutput(...)
* Added functionality to delete output files once they are read. This saved memory for large simulation projects (ie when monitoring convergence)

autovar.py
* Added functionality to disable feedback during simulation

dpm.py - woodDecayVTT(...)
* Added round result to nearest integer

dpm.py - mouldVTTupdate(...)
* Added round rousult to nearest multiple of 0.5


V0.3.0
Added functionality to monitor convergence and add samples sequentially - see example 2
dmp.py - freezeThawCyclesDTU(...)
* Error fix in calculation of moist freeze-thaw cycles


V0.2.1
sampling.py - main(...)
* Error fix in discrete distributions


V0.2.0
supp.py - readOutput(...)
* Added multiprocessing to read multiple output files at once(faster processing)


V0.1.3
autovar.py and supp.py
* added encoding='utf8' to read and write dpj file


V0.1.2
dpm.py - woodDecayVTT(...)
* Bug fix - if ML[t-1] == 100: ML.append(100)


V0.1.1
climateFun.py
* Added functionallity to use functions outside of probabilistic study: 
  number = None -> ccd file will be saved without a number
* Added calcSWRad to calculate short wave radiation based on diffuse and direct radiation
  
supp.py - saveCCD(...)
* Edited the way the climate parameter is extracted from the path to avoid errors

supp.py - readOutput(...)
* Edited the way the parameters and numbers of the output files are extracted to avoid errors

supp.py - headerccd(...)
* Added ShortWaveRadiation - SWHRAD for calcSWRad from climateFun.py

dpm.py - freezeThawCyclesDTU(...)
* Added additional outputs: timeseries of freeze-thaw cycles and moist freeze-thaw cycles
